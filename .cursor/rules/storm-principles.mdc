# STORM Principles for Writing World-Class Technical Web Development Articles

## I. Source (S) - Research and Information Gathering

### Primary Sources
- Official framework/library documentation (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- GitHub repositories and discussions
- Technical specifications (W3C, ECMAScript, etc.)
- Developer experience reports from engineering blogs
- Performance benchmarks and metrics

### Secondary Sources
- Conference talks and technical presentations
- Academic papers on web technologies
- Industry surveys and reports
- Stack Overflow discussions (carefully vetted)

### Validation Requirements
- Test all code examples in multiple environments
- Verify browser compatibility claims
- Cross-reference performance metrics
- Confirm accessibility compliance
- Check security best practices

## II. Tone (T) - Writing Style and Approach

### Technical Authenticity
- Include real-world code examples with error handling
- Show both successful and failure scenarios
- Demonstrate debugging approaches
- Include performance implications
- Document browser compatibility considerations

### Conversational Style
- Open with relatable development challenges
- Use analogies to explain complex concepts
- Include "gotchas" and lessons learned
- Share personal experiences with the technology
- Maintain professional but approachable language

### Example Structure

```javascript
// ❌ Instead of dry technical explanation
const data = await fetch('/api/users');
// ✅ Add context and real-world scenarios
// When building a dashboard, you might need to fetch user data:
try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/users');
    if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(HTTP error! status: ${response.status});
    }
    const data = await response.json();
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch users:', error);
    // Show user-friendly error message
    showErrorNotification('Unable to load user data');
}
```


## III. Objectives (O) - Clear Learning Goals

### Section-Level Goals
1. Understanding the Concept
   - Define the web development concept clearly
   - Explain where it fits in the development stack
   - Compare with alternative approaches

2. Implementation Knowledge

   - Configuration requirements
   - Common pitfalls and solutions

3. Best Practices
   - Performance optimization techniques
   - Security considerations
   - Accessibility requirements
   - Testing strategies

### Example Learning Objectives

After reading this section on React Server Components, you will:
- Understand the difference between server and client components
- Know when to use each type of component
- Be able to implement basic server components
- Understand the performance implications
- Know how to debug common issues

## IV. Research (R) - Technical Depth

### Implementation Details
- Include complete working examples
- Show file structure and configuration
- Document dependencies and versions
- Provide setup instructions
- Include error handling

### Validation Steps
