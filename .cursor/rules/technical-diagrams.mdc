# Technical Diagram Standards

## Diagram Types and Requirements

1. **Architecture Diagrams**
   - System components clearly labeled
   - Data flow directions indicated
   - Integration points marked
   - Scale indicators where relevant
   - Clear hierarchy of components
   - Environment boundaries marked

2. **Flow Charts**
   - Clear start and end points
   - Decision points clearly marked
   - Error paths in red
   - Success paths in green
   - Consistent flow direction
   - Numbered steps where applicable

3. **Sequence Diagrams**
   - Actor/system labels at top
   - Time flows top to bottom
   - Async operations marked
   - Error scenarios included
   - Clear return values
   - Timing indicators where relevant

## Visual Standards

### Color Scheme
- Primary: #007AFF (Blue)
- Success: #34C759 (Green)
- Warning: #FF9500 (Orange)
- Error: #FF3B30 (Red)
- Neutral: #8E8E93 (Gray)

### Typography
- Title: 24px, Bold
- Headings: 18px, Semi-bold
- Labels: 14px, Regular
- Notes: 12px, Italic
- Font Family: System UI

### Layout
- Left-to-right flow for architecture
- Top-to-bottom flow for sequences
- Consistent spacing (20px between elements)
- Clear grouping with borders/backgrounds
- Maximum width: 800px
- Minimum element size: 40px

## Accessibility Requirements

### Alt Text Structure
```markdown
![Architecture diagram showing the feature flag system with three main components: API Gateway, Flag Service, and Database. Data flows from left to right, with the API Gateway handling client requests, the Flag Service managing feature states, and the Database storing configurations.](./architecture-diagram.svg)
```

### Color Requirements
- Minimum contrast ratio: 4.5:1
- Don't rely on color alone
- Use patterns/shapes for distinction
- Support dark/light modes
- Provide high contrast version

### Text Requirements
- Minimum font size: 12px
- Clear font family
- No text in raster images
- SVG text elements preferred

## Tools and Export

### Excalidraw Setup
```typescript
const diagramConfig = {
  theme: 'light',
  exportScale: 2,
  exportWithBackground: true,
  exportWithDarkMode: false,
  gridSize: 20,
};
```

### Export Formats
- SVG for web (preferred)
- PNG as fallback
- PDF for print
- Include source files

### Responsive Design
- Viewbox set correctly
- Preserve aspect ratio
- Min-width defined
- Max-width defined
- Mobile-friendly scaling

## Example Implementation

```astro
---
import Excalidraw from '@/components/custom/Excalidraw.astro';
---

<Excalidraw
  src="./architecture-diagram.excalidraw"
  alt="Feature flag system architecture"
  darkMode={false}
  scale={2}
/>
```
