👋 Hey! I'm Ben, a Senior Developer at [Shopify](https://shopify.com) working from the beautiful Saguenay region in QC, Canada. I love building fast, modern web apps and tools that don't suck. These days, I'm crafting e-commerce experiences and helping merchants succeed in their online ventures.

🏔️ Outside of work, I'm probably shredding down a mountain somewhere (on skis or a bike, depending on the season). I geek out about web frameworks, dev tools, and sharing what I learn along the way.
