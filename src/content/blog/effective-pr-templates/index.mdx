# Creating Effective GitHub Pull Request Templates

Pull Request (PR) templates are powerful tools that help standardize the code review process and ensure important information is consistently shared across your team. Let's explore how to create and implement effective PR templates.

> [!NOTE]
> A well-structured PR template can significantly improve code review quality and reduce back-and-forth communication between developers.

## Why Use PR Templates?

Common issues that PR templates help solve:

- PRs with no or minimal description
- Missing context about the problem being solved
- Unclear testing procedures
- Lack of standardization across team contributions

## Setting Up Your Template

GitHub offers several ways to add PR templates to your repository. Here's the most common approach:

```markdown title=".github/pull_request_template.md"
## Description

<!-- Provide a clear and concise description of your changes -->

## Problem

<!-- What problem does this PR solve? Link to related issues if applicable -->

## Solution

<!-- How did you solve the problem? -->

## Testing

<!-- Describe the testing you've done -->

- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Manual testing completed
- [ ] Integration tests if applicable

## Screenshots

<!-- If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your changes -->

## Additional Notes

<!-- Any additional information that reviewers should know? -->
```

> [!TIP]
> Place your template in `.github/pull_request_template.md` for it to be automatically used when creating new PRs.

## Template Sections Explained

### 1. Description Section

The description should be clear and concise:

```markdown
## Description

- What: Added dark mode support to the blog
- Why: Improve user experience in low-light conditions
- How: Implemented using Tailwind's dark mode utilities
```

### 2. Problem Statement

Always provide context:

```markdown
## Problem

The current authentication flow doesn't handle expired tokens,
causing users to be unexpectedly logged out.

Related Issue: #123
```

### 3. Testing Checklist

A comprehensive testing section ensures quality:

```markdown
## Testing

- [x] Tested in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- [x] Verified mobile responsiveness
- [x] Added unit tests for token refresh logic
- [ ] Updated documentation
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep It Focused**

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Each PR should address a single concern. If you find yourself writing a long description covering multiple changes, consider splitting the PR.

2. **Use Checklists**

   ```markdown
   ## Pre-merge Checklist

   - [ ] Code follows project style guidelines
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   - [ ] Tests added/updated
   - [ ] CI checks passing
   ```

3. **Include Visual Context**

   ```markdown
   ## Visual Changes

   ### Before

   ![Before screenshot]()

   ### After

   ![After screenshot]()
   ```

## Advanced Template Features

### Conditional Sections

You can use HTML comments to provide guidance that won't appear in the final PR:

```markdown
<!-- Delete sections that are not applicable -->

## API Changes

<!-- If you've modified the API, describe the changes here -->

## Database Changes

<!-- For PRs that include database schema changes -->
```

### Template Variations

For larger projects, you might want different templates for different types of changes:

```typescript title="Example Directory Structure"
.github/
  PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/
    feature.md
    bugfix.md
    hotfix.md
```

> [!WARNING]
> While multiple templates provide flexibility, they can also add complexity. Start with a single template and split only when necessary.

## Implementation Steps

1. Create the template directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/
   ```

2. Add your template file:

   ```bash
   touch .github/pull_request_template.md
   ```

3. Commit and push to your default branch:
   ```bash
   git add .github/
   git commit -m "Add PR template"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Conclusion

An effective PR template is a living document that should evolve with your team's needs. Start with the basics and iterate based on feedback. Remember, the goal is to improve communication and code quality, not to create bureaucracy.

The best templates strike a balance between structure and flexibility, providing enough guidance to ensure consistency while not being overly prescriptive. Regular reviews and updates of your template based on team feedback will help maintain its effectiveness over time.
